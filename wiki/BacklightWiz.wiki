#summary Simple control panel addon object enabling great control over screen brightness and backlight timers

= Details =

when you have it on lowest brightness, it kind of auto-dims even dimmer a bit before the autolock kicks in. users will be able to make the autolock vs autodim work for them and respect whether the keypad is open, and other factors. also invoke a brightness toggle using buttons/shortcut mode, for this i am imagining a 3 stage control similar to the power control widget, however it will be fine tuned to a literal backlight OFF/20%/80%. that function will work directly with settings from shortcutter.

another option within this object will allow a user to specify a shorter backlight timeout when the lockscreen is only being viewed
