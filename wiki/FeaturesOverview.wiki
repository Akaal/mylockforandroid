  * Toggle myLock on & off via the settings screen
  * Toggle persistent mode which ensures myLock will be kept running by the OS & provides a shortcut to the settings screen in the notification menu, very convenient to quickly enable stay awake when you need it.
  * Toggle stay awake mode to keep the screen from sleeping, perfect for web browsing. Very easy to check on or off whenever you need it paired with the foreground mode shortcut.
  * Toggle a preview version of our lockscreen replacement. It cannot yet house widgets & shortcuts so I don't recommend keeping it on but feel free to check it out. The beta version performs much faster and will preview notification panel and button customization in the next alpha release
