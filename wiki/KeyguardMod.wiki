#summary Base UI and master process framework for all other objects

= Introduction =

To accomplish the starting point for this project, we need to learn how to instate our own custom keyguard environment. The foundation for the rest of the components of this project is the modified keyguard on which we can place addon objects such as the notificationpreview

= Details =

I am researching how much we need to interact with what's called the keyguard manager in order to accomplish the input on the lockscreen. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/KeyguardManager.html

Based on the way the documentation talks about "showing the keyguard" it seems like this means the lock screen itself (not the more abstract state of having functions locked) is the keyguard. So this allows us to infer that we can reprogram the lockscreen environment to accomplish our goal, and not worry about a specific state of lockdown. When keyguard is invoked it seems to be simultaneously "showing the keyguard" and turning off the backlight & display.

See other app examples such as Lock 2.0, which allows a user to open the notification panel while the keyguard is being shown.
