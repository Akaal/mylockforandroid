#summary master process framework for skipping the keyguard and acquiring wakelocks so we can open our fancy homescreen with ease!

= Why have a keyguard without any keys of note? =

The useful thing of the keyguard is really in the regulation of it going back to sleep again faster when you haven't interacted with the device, giving you a slightly longer timeout if you have touched something and even longer if you have opened the slide. Give the user the option of different ways to wake up the screen so that it can't accidentally be done (necessarily), such as require double lock button press, or a press followed by a shake. I can see even using one of the touch buttons such as home in a long press to facilitate wakeup. Keyguard effectively morphs into a screenguard of sorts.

= Keyguard skipping vs guarded wakeup = 
This is essentially the users INPUT gatekeeper to getting/releasing wakelocks and the keyguard. It facilitates skipping the default keyguard and takes the user straight to the home/last running activity, or invoking some form of keyguard window or homescreen as opposed to the most recent activity

myLock is aiming for is giving users the ability to unlock/relock/wakeup in other quicker methods besides the default in android, also.

==  Power control concerns: when to re-sleep? ==
myLock will take efficient control of how long the screen stays & how bright in the absence of user originated sleep commands. This is the gatekeeper to respect the user's intent for viewing or input on the device, it knows when to sleep or how bright to be and in what ways, depending on circumstances of what just happened!

in 2.0 it kind of auto-dims before the autolock kicks in. users will be able to make the autosleep vs autodim work for them and respect whether the keypad is open, and other factors. also invoke a brightness toggle using buttons/shortcut mode, for this i am imagining a 3 stage control similar to the power control widget, however it will be fine tuned to a literal backlight OFF/20%/80%. that function will work directly with settings from shortcutter.


==Some Code Stuff==

The current default keys that get suppressed from waking up the screen are defined in KeyguardViewMediator.java -- redefining these to allow more control over the backlight and further allow it to re-sleep faster when keyguard is being shown could be part of this addon. 
{{{
    private boolean isWakeKeyWhenKeyguardShowing(int keyCode) {
        switch (keyCode) {
            case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_VOLUME_UP:
            case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_VOLUME_DOWN:
            case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MUTE:
            case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_HEADSETHOOK: 
            case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE: 
            case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_STOP: 
            case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_NEXT: 
            case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_PREVIOUS: 
            case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_REWIND: 
            case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_FAST_FORWARD:
            case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_CAMERA:
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}}}

We need to give permission in the manifest to disable the keyguard
{{{
<uses-permission
    android:name="android.permission.DISABLE_KEYGUARD" />
}}}

Manifest:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
      package="i4nc4mp.skipKeyguard"
      android:versionCode="1"
      android:versionName="1.0">
    <application android:icon="@drawable/icon" android:label="@string/app_name">
        <activity android:name=".skSettings"
                  android:label="@string/app_name">
            <intent-filter>

                <action android:name="android.intent.action.SCREEN_OFF" />

        </activity>

    </application>
    <uses-permission
    android:name="android.permission.DISABLE_KEYGUARD" />
    <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="6" />

===Transition from simple KG skip to power controls & input monitoring===
Currently our code just responds to screen_on/off broadcasts and enables or disables keyguard. The new code needs to accomplish a few specifics

1- Persistant service which can catch any key events, so that users can specify which keys they want to use to wake or unlock.
2- Functions/methods which call the different types of wakeup/unlock. This is so that they are independent of the circumstance they will be invoked under, allowing our customization to work easily. User pref of whether to use the custom home or the regular home and only call up shortcutter when needed. Types of wakeup/unlock:
  *Wake to a mimiced default keyguard
  *Wake to the shortCutter window
  *Wake to the clock shortCutter/customized home (welcome screen of sorts where the regular home can still be accessed by pressing home)
  *Skip keyguard directly to chosen home screen
3- Implement the first basics of re-sleep regulation. I don't know if we will need to place very much for this initially but the framework should be considered to allow our planned customizations in future builds
