#summary Keyguard makes no sense when there are no significant keys. What you need is a screenguard paired with a really useful homescreen!

= Project plans =

I have identified 3 steps to the realization of the myLock vision in the first weeks of research and initial alpha programming.

  * The existing keyguard is an obstruction to end user convenience on the Droid since the device has no face buttons; since the only way to even awaken it is the power button on top (impossible to pocket-press accidentally vs the volume or camera keys could be) we will begin this project by simply bypassing the lockscreen automatically.
  * The existing keyguard is not 100% obstruction. It does give us some examples of useful ideas that we want to retain. On the first screen the user sees on wakeup, it is a nice option to have clock display and some shortcuts. We will create a utility widget of sorts to converge the idea of the clock display, battery %, some power controls such as a brightness level button and optional switches for other power-consuming componenets, and of course the silent mode/vibrate toggle similar to the one on the default lockscreen.
  * Finally, it would be useful to see a timeline of waiting events that have occurred while the device has slept in the wakeup or regular homescreen. The creation of this will be most complicated, as it seems it will require programming mini clients for email, twitter, SMS handling, and phone-event handling. I am not sure we have any way to talk to the existing notification panel or pull information from the default email client at all.

= On backwards compatibility =
in 2.0 the change to onstartcommand and startforeground are used instead of onstart and setforeground

also, the welcomeactivity code doesn't seem to exist in the older versions. will have to try to grab some source and see if they had alarm clocks and what their method was.
for now this isn't really a goal.. i'm guessing android will go forward at 2.0 and up pretty strongly considering the announcements that g1 should receive it officially.

= Different release versions =
  * myLock lite - lockscreen bypass: Best for users who just want the slider to be gone, and don't need to use the recent apps function often. The app switcher still works but just isn't initialized immediately upon unlock, like in alpha 1 the home must be launched once to complete the lockscreen dismissal and initialize the feature. Since the only way to initialize it for immediate use is to insert a delay in the unlock which fully exits the lockscreen before proceeding (alpha 2 and beyond), the lite release will be the least intrusive and fastest performing. Other versions will also include the choice to operate in lite mode.
  * myLock complete: Full feature set release incorporating all the customizations we have planned. Users will be able to use lite mode, regular mode, or wakeup homescreen. User choice of stay awake mode, settings notification shortcut, widget feature toggles, and the option to have shake do a specific type of unlock (example - use wakeup homescreen only on shake), as well as our utility widgets for clock, sound, brightness, and battery info.
  * myLock event timeline: feature under review, a great idea and the implementation is very complex
