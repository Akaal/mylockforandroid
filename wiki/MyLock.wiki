#summary Keyguard makes no sense when there are no significant keys. What you need is a screenguard paired with a really useful homescreen!

= Philosophy =

  * Convenience: Place important functions more accessible to the end user, improving the total android experience by shortening the steps to perform the most immediately used functions / information requests
  * Customization: Let users decide what programs and/or contacts they want to be monitored by NotificationPreview, let them have a customized shortcuts interface, and many choices of how to wake up the screen for interaction that are better than the default keyguard.
  * Control: Avoid frustrations which occur in the default autolock and auto-dim functionality, put user back in control of these in a way that is smarter for overall power management and "real-world" use of the device.
