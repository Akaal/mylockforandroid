#summary Keyguard makes no sense when there are no significant keys. What you need is a screenguard paired with a really useful homescreen!

= Philosophy =

  * Convenience: Place important functions more accessible to the end user, improving the total android experience by shortening the steps to perform the most immediately used functions / information requests
  * Customization: Let users decide what programs and/or contacts they want to be monitored by NotificationPreview, let them have a customized shortcuts interface, and many choices of how to wake up the screen for interaction that are better than the default keyguard.
  * Control: Avoid frustrations which occur in the default autolock and auto-dim functionality, put user back in control of these in a way that is smarter for overall power management and "real-world" use of the device.

== NotificationPreview ==
This concept is the basic inspiration for the design of this app. It will put users in control of their own personal message timeline which grabs all communication while the device sleeps, saving time when users do have a second to check up on the messages just by viewing the lockscreen. by default it collects all notifications which contain text, and is able to be scrolled without unlocking to view all when many have collected. this can also be used to set if you want to put custom LED notification for a specific event type. option filter out contacts/apps or just set a whitelist if you only need to preview specific contacts. eventually, great facebook and twitter (also potentially email to show you who the waiting email is from and a subject preview with tap and hold to load a tooltip with body text) integration will become available as well so that if you don't have twidroid or other clients you can still connect these accounts to your preview panel to grab posts on your wall and @ mentions. at initial I will only have it set so it can interact with apps that place notifications (I use twidroid so I am expecting in the earliest versions I can have it see twidroid notifications)
