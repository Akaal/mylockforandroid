#summary Info on how myLock can help users who want to get in and out of pattern mode

= Introduction =

So far I've researched and the only thing turned up is some info on system settings. I need to check out the source for the stock settings activity to determine how feasible this is. I'm told there is an app AutoLock which seems like it might be skipping the lock in an interesting fashion, doing a delay before lockscreen kicks in. To me this seems to mean that you wake it back up without any unlock slider until the set time elapses, then you would see the pattern or lockscreen.

_"update system set value=0 where name='lock_pattern_autolock';"

Settings.System.putInt(this.getContentResolver(), "mySetting", 1); 
int setting = 0; 
try { 
    setting = Settings.System.getInt(this.getContentResolver(), "mySetting"); 
} catch (SettingNotFoundException e) { 
    Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Setting mySetting not found"); 
} 
Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Setting mySetting: " + setting);
