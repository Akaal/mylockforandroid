#summary An addon object which allows input shortcuts that will unlock and launch straight into the chosen app or function.

= Introduction =

This functionality will allow users to place shortcuts that originate both from the touch-buttons (menu, home, back, search) and also an optional lockscreen panel (two options, a circle that takes up the upper half as a 2nd-home-screen style panel of the lockscreen, or a compact one with 4 options that lives at the very bottom, just above the touch-buttons).

The basic idea that this addon should follow is that all unlock shortcuts will be invoked by grab+Drag behavior that's responsive like the default shortcut that exists in 2.0 - the silent mode drag circle. The only exception will be on the touch-buttons, which could be allowed to activate with long-press at the users preference but also support touch, then drag off.

This concept is its own object because it combines unlocking with launching an app. Additionally it can invoke toggles without unlocking, such as the brightness control from BacklightWiz

Our current base idea for this involves a circular menu of shortcuts. I have several ideas for this. One of which a static half circle goes around a GO icon, and you drag any shortcut into the centerpoint and release it to GO. Another is a "scrolling wheel" of shortcuts so you can have many. tap and hold on one "Frees" it to move like when you pick up an icon on the home screen, so drag and drop it on GO to launch. 

lastly, all shortcuts hidden till one touches the GO android guy, then they are displayed (static position) and you drag the android buddy to one and hold there for a moment till haptic feedback occurs, then release to launch.
