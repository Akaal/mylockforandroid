#summary A widget that saves space for useful shortcuts. Touch the shortcutter GO android and your shortcuts will appear in a circular pattern around it. Drag onto one and release to launch your app or function!

= Introduction =
I'd like to potentially also include options to remap the camera key or program shortcuts onto long presses of menu or search. Other than that the widget really serves a very straight forward purpose of organizing shortcuts you want in a happier UI that saves space and looks prettier all at once.


= Details =

Our current base idea for this involves a circular menu of shortcuts. I have several ideas for this. A "scrolling wheel" of shortcuts so you can have many. tap and hold on one "Frees" it to move like when you pick up an icon on the home screen, so drag and drop it on GO to launch. 

the other method would be to have all shortcuts hidden till one touches the GO android guy, then they are displayed (static position) and you drag the android buddy to one and hold there for a moment till haptic feedback occurs, then release to launch.

= Replace the quick 6-most-recent app switcher =
The app-switcher appears to be a type of keyguard, as it gets blocked sometimes by our skip code. Seems like an all around good idea to put that function in customization control of our users by replacing it with ShortCutter! 

Unless there is a new trick in 2.0, it seems that there is no good way to invoke alternative functionality or skip what's happening with the home longpress. 

After some thought, it appears that LOCK 2.0 is also using the home replacement trick after skipping keyguard (their app explicitly warns you not to choose it as the "Default Home" hehe). So in all reality, different methods of behavior for a home-replacing shortcutter implementation is our best bet, and functionally identical to any hopes of mimicing/enhancing keyguard-like behavior
