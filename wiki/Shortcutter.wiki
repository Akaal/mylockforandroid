#summary An addon object which allows input shortcuts that will unlock and launch straight into the chosen app or function.

= Introduction =

This functionality will allow users to place shortcuts that originate both from the touch-buttons (menu, home, back, search) and also an optional lockscreen panel (two options, a circle that takes up the upper half as a 2nd-home-screen style panel of the lockscreen, or a compact one with 4 options that lives at the very bottom, just above the touch-buttons)


= Details =

This concept is its own object because it combines unlocking with launching an app. Additionally it can invoke toggles without unlocking, such as the brightness control from BrightnessWizard
