#summary Known solutions for problems we can't fix in the code

= I can't install it, getting "error parsing package" =

This error has been reported by non-rooted milestone users. I do not know the cause. I am hoping I can resolve this for milestone install by releasing on the market. If not on milestone, according to my research this error happens when directly trying to open the APK file. I have always downloaded and installed the packages for testing via dolphin browser, and never experienced error. I've also read that you can install a file manager such as androzip to get past this error. 


= It stopped working and won't work again even though I've uninstalled and reinstalled =

In the most recent versions this should not happen unless an unexpected interaction with other apps that also work with the lockscreen bypass. I have noticed that in the lite version or with persistent mode disabled that the app can also be stopped by the OS during routine memory management, but is normally restarted quickly. This error can also happen if screen goes off after the stop, before the restart finishes. It is very rare. I am working on a fix which will allow us to run the app service immune to those stops without requiring the persistent notification.

To get it working again you need to reboot the device by removing the battery for a few seconds. No other method of restart or re-install will get past the safety block the lockscreen imposes. The block will stop all apps from interacting with the lockscreen. I know this from testing with early versions that had different crashes which were fixed on the path from alpha 1 to alpha 2c. I have not yet had any crash scenarios for 2c reported, so things are looking good.

= It seems to wakeup very slowly or lagged. Sometimes it goes so slow that the lockscreen never goes away but I can slide and unlock =
This appears to be something that happens regardless of myLock. An example is if you slide it open you'll notice a responsiveness delay as the CPU tasks both rotating & redrawing the lockscreen at once. In addition, I've confirmed that task managers and task killer apps will create noticable lag as they have to frequently load the CPU anytime the screen is awakened to refresh their list of processes. We do not recommend using task management apps because android already polices memory usage very strictly to ensure stability. 

= Sometimes I see the  lockscreen flash for an instant, or even linger for a moment after the phone wakes up=
This happens in alpha 2b and beyond, because we have to tell the main android system that the lockscreen has been dismissed. That fails unless the screen has been awakened and a temporary lockscreen bypass has been initiated. Then we have to create a short delay (50 milliseconds) that the OS expects because the scenario they designed lockscreen bypassing for is where your app ends up getting input from the user that needs to launch something else, at which point it goes back and checks if a password lock was set. For whatever reason, when it does that the flash occurs when secure mode isn't on. If the CPU is loaded it can be up longer. That happens even if you are using the regular unlock of the lockscreen at load.

= Why do the volume or camera buttons wake it back up sometimes? =
This is one of the rules of the lockscreen. When a timeout sleep occurs you have a short grace period in which the lockscreen isn't yet engaged, thus allowing any action at all to awaken it again quickly. That means any button, as well as even sliding the slider closed which normally doesn't trigger a wakeup.

= Known apps that conflict with stable myLock operation =
  * Handcent sms - popup feature tries to call a duplicate lockscreen disable due to pre 2.0 compatibility. Reportedly works with the alpha 1 release.
  * Not confirmed but it is likely sms popup also has same issue as handcent. I recommend using executive assistant and putting the widget on your homescreen. The sms tab is a great replacement for the popup feature.
  * Screebl - seems to work by reading the screen on and off events myLock also relies on but as far as I know it doesn't use lockscreen disabling. Users have reported it doesn't work correctly.
  * AutoLock - can't function to restore pattern unlock mode due to interference from our lockscreen disable commands. Auto pattern lockdown is planned for a future release.
  * I'm going to assume you can't use Lock 2.0 or Lockbot since they are cosmetic themable lockscreens.
  * Any task killer - again we don't recommend these at all, not necessary on android. It will cause slowness.
