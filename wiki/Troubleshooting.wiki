#summary Known solutions for problems we can't fix in the code - these are almost entirely applicable only to the first market beta and release alpha 2c and earlier.

= MOST IMPORTANT: DOWNLOAD LOG COLLECTOR =
If you can email me a log immediately after a problem happens, I can know exactly why the problem happened and actually roll out a fix or a message to the dev of the app that caused the issue if it was a conflict. All you have to do is open Log Collector and put in our email (mylockandroid at gmail). In the subject, put the time you think the problem happened and what the problem was (IE: Lockscreen came back and wouldn't go away, Screen Came on but flashed back off, etc). If you can, please also go to Settings => Applications => Running Services and tell me what is running, that will give me an idea if any other persistent app is going that might not be putting things in the Log.

= UNINSTALL YOUR TASK KILLER =
Task killers cause the phone to run slower and cause massive problems for many apps. There is no benefit or upside.

= Why isn't there an option to get rid of the status icon =
There is. We've tried, but there is no way to work around having the icon in place. You might experience a sudden loss of functionality and have to go back into settings & re-toggle the app if you operate without the persistent icon. In my testing this seems quite rare but every user's setup will be different depending on everything they regularly use on the device. For more about this, check out the official android development post that explains- http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/02/service-api-changes-starting-with.html

= Why do the volume or camera buttons wake it back up sometimes? =
This is one of the rules of the lockscreen. When a timeout sleep occurs you have a short grace period in which the lockscreen isn't yet engaged, thus allowing any action at all to awaken it again quickly. That means any button, as well as even sliding the slider closed which normally doesn't trigger a wakeup.

= How do I use the app and still get handcent popups? (Alpha 2c) =
In handcent go to settings > poup setting > enable 'Screen on for Popup', disable 'Show on locked'. This will ensure myLock still works and the two don't cause havoc as they both attempt to react to wakeup. This is only applicable to the market v1 (alpha 2c download here on the project page). We have fixed handcent interaction for the a3 revision.

= It stopped working and won't work again even though I've uninstalled and reinstalled (alpha 2c) =

To get it working again the device needs to be rebooted by removing the battery for a few seconds. No other method of restart or re-install will get past the safety block the lockscreen imposes. The block will stop all apps from interacting with the lockscreen. I know this from testing with early versions that had different crashes which were fixed on the path from alpha 1 to alpha 2c. I have not yet had any crash scenarios for 2c reported, so things are looking good.

= It seems to wakeup very slowly or lagged. Sometimes it goes so slow that the lockscreen never goes away but I can slide and unlock =
This appears to be something that happens regardless of myLock. An example is if you slide it open you'll notice a responsiveness delay as the CPU tasks both rotating & redrawing the lockscreen at once. In addition, I've confirmed that task managers and task killer apps will create noticable lag as they have to frequently load the CPU anytime the screen is awakened to refresh their list of processes. We do not recommend using task management apps because android already polices memory usage very strictly to ensure stability. 

= It goes to sleep too fast when I wake it up and don't immediately take further action =
This currently only impacts lite mode (activated with the widget button). This is because the lockscreen is only being paused. It is not actually cleared unless home key is used. Therefore, it follows the rule of the lockscreen that times out in 5 seconds unless interaction triggers the regular timeout delay. Lite mode will likely become retired once the beta is released because we use a custom lockscreen to get more consistent performance.
