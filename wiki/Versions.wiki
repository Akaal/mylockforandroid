#summary myLock has a Simple as well as a Complete release version

= Simple =
Just skips through lockscreen so you don't have to slide to unlock, but also no need to worry about pocket unlock since side buttons will remain locked.

= Complete =

3 customizable modes implementing the custom lockscreen users can personalize with homescreen widgets.

  * Security mode - The lockscreen shows first. When exited, the normal unlock screen appears. Can be used with or without pattern security, however pattern mode is recommended to reduce redundancy.
  * Guarded mode - The lockscreen is only awakened by power key, slider open, or keypad buttons. Replaces the lockscreen without re-defining lock behavior.
  * Advanced mode - The lockscreen can wake up with any key. Instant unlock or advanced lockdown can optionally be set up for any key. Optional advanced power save mode sets a quicker timeout when the lockscreen is awakened.

Security timer allows users to set a number of minutes after which the pattern mode will engage. Ensure you have set a pattern first, myLock automatically suppresses it and engages the timer so the security screen is not in your face every time.

Launch *Personalize Lockscreen* to set the widgets you want. This will allow any of the modes to display your widgets after easy setup. Need to change the widgets? Just choose reset from the menu.
