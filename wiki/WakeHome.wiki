#summary It's your home away from home.... a place to put widgets and shortcuts you want to see every time you wake up your device.

= Things to know =

This handy component gives users the option of a new home screen that takes over the role of the default lockscreen, an app that will be launched when the device is awakened. 

This is truly nothing more than an app modeled after the default home application that gets resumed immediately after the keyguard skip on awakening. The user has the option of interacting with the widgets/shortcuts they have placed on the screen, pressing menu to open the customization options (add or remove widgets & shortcuts), press back to hop back to what you were last doing before sleep, or press home to access the regular home environment, as always.
