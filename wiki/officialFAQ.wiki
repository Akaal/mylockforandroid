#summary Useful information that I am finding to be constantly asked on our threads

= What is myLock? =

It is an app whose primary function is to replace the lockscreen. It has several sub-features that go along with this goal.

= Why did you make it? =
The guiding principle is one simple fact: we don't like having to slide to unlock.
We want to use the device on the first interaction, and not require a redundant slide action. It's a little surprising that the option not to have the lockscreen isn't already built into the OS. Off, keyguard, or pattern lock seem like suitable choices for end users, so myLock wants to step in to provide the Off category. Although the OS has provided tools for making the lockscreen go away, they are only designed for use cases like pushing a popup to the screen automatically (such as the default alarm clock). As a result we might go as far as doing a firmware mod for install on root devices to accomplish parts of the goal that are off-limits to regular apps.

= But I want a quick way to disable pattern lock also, can myLock do this? =
Yes we can. The Lite version implements this currently (started in v1a), automatically pausing pattern mode when myLock starts. It will automatically retain your pattern in the system settings and restart lockdown mode when you stop myLock.

= Will myLock also offer customization for backlight timers? =
Probably. Don't confuse the lockscreen functionality with auto-sleep or auto-dim functionalities, which are governed separately. We're working on this to see how much we can do in the boundaries set for apps. Currently we offer a stay awake toggle to prevent the timeout lock.

= Can you program customization for different buttons or touching the screen or touch buttons to wake it or unlock it? =
No. The android operating system gives us two choices only. Either stick to power button, slide open, any key on slideout (the rules set by the existing lockscreen) or else allow all keys to wake it unconditionally. We can't discriminate once in the all key mode. Keyguard disabler and screenmodewidget are examples of that mode, very simple, a bit obtuse since camera and volume keys are easy to accidental press in the pocket. Our lockscreen replacement could provide the option to wake the lockscreen with any key but specify which keys will bypass it- customized unlock keys in other words.

= But can you program shake unlocking? =
No. This is thanks to a wonderful enhancement that came along with 2.0.1, blocking apps other than system apps from listening to sensors during screen off. This is similar to how we cannot customize the buttons, it is because the OS has not provided any method apps can enforce different wakeup rules. 

= Can you create a custom lockdown mode requiring a password? =
We're researching this. It is definitely possible. There is an app called wave secure which has a lockdown like this. We just aren't sure how useful a standalone lockdown would be in the long run. It wouldn't be able to stop incoming call usage.

= Can you give preferences to answer incoming call without using the touchscreen too? =
Not sure yet. This is a really good idea, as the "call lockscreen" does stand in your way just like the regular one.

= Sometimes I see the  lockscreen flash for an instant, or even linger for a moment after the phone wakes up... WTF? =
This happens in alpha 2b and beyond, because we have to tell the main android system that the lockscreen has been dismissed. That fails unless the screen has been awakened and a temporary lockscreen bypass has been initiated. Then we have to create a short delay (50 milliseconds) that the OS expects because the scenario they designed lockscreen bypassing for is where your app ends up getting input from the user that needs to launch something else, at which point it goes back and checks if a password lock was set. For whatever reason, when it does that the flash occurs when secure mode isn't on. If the CPU is loaded it can be up longer. That happens even if you are using the regular unlock of the lockscreen at load.

= Why do the volume or camera buttons wake it back up sometimes? =
This is one of the rules of the lockscreen. When a timeout sleep occurs you have a short grace period in which the lockscreen isn't yet engaged, thus allowing any action at all to awaken it again quickly. That means any button, as well as even sliding the slider closed which normally doesn't trigger a wakeup.

= What's the welcome-screen/wakeup homescreen? =
Tentatively titled WakeHome, we are designing a very simple emulation of the stock homescreen with just a single screen, capable of displaying any widget of your choice in addition to any shortcut or app launch icon. Simply a port of the those features from the stock Launcher app. Essentially this is the alternative to quick unlock function (which exists simply to bypass the lockscreen slider and take you to what you were last doing). This mode is inspired by the silencer slider/clock display on the default lockscreen. Why not just make it an extra homescreen and let the user decide what to put there?

= What's notification preview? =
This is a plan for the full final version of the app, way down the road. We think it would be excellent to have a timeline of missed events displayed on the wakeup screen, customized by user to what types of events have the priority of being shown there. A converged view for the timeline of any unread IMs, twitter, sms, email, missed call, voicemail. We might limit this to gmail, sms, gtalk, & gvoice and see how it goes.

= It causes me a problem with <insert app name>... WTF? =
it is hard to make the app play nice with other home or screenwake mods because they all rely on workarounds in android to work cleanly. when all these workarounds go in and try to execute in near-tandem, unexpected results will happen. I am aware it doesn't work with screebl and a few others. See the troubleshooting FAQ for more details.

= I can't find you on the market? =
That's because myLock isn't on the market yet. I would really like to be, but I'm going to need some donations, as it costs a $25 fee for devs to join the market. I am choosing to create this app as a free & open source project to benefit android lovers, so I imagine once I place it in the app store I will have a donation version also allowing people to buy it for 2 dollars alongside the free download. myLock will never contain ads.

= How do I send you my idea/feedback/bug complaint? =
Email the project mylockandroid at gmail. You can also follow us on twitter and tweet at us if your comment is short. Can't guarantee I'll notice your comments elsewhere like blog, wiki, or will be aware of posts on forums.
