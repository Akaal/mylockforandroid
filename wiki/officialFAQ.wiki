#summary Useful information that I am finding to be constantly asked on our threads

= What is myLock? =

It is an app whose primary function is to replace the lockscreen. It has several sub-features that go along with this goal.

= Why did you make it? =
The guiding principle is one simple fact: we don't like having to slide to unlock.
We want to use the device as fast as we can press power, slide open the device, or do a shake.

= But I want to use myLock as a quick way to disable pattern lock also, can myLock do this? =
Speculation: I believe we can program that and place the option as a widget or a button in the util widget. I'll look into whether our app can be permitted to toggle off your secure mode in the root settings. I am doubtful of that method but my co-worker says he has an app that gives a shortcut for secure mode on and off. In alpha 2b and beyond, the app just does nothing if a pattern is set. When you wake it up, myLock still has to call and authenticate with the password keeper of the OS in order to work correctly even when no password is set. 

= Will myLock also offer customization for backlight timers? =
Probably. Don't confuse the lockscreen functionality with auto-sleep or auto-dim functionalities, which are governed separately. I'd like to make it so you get a longer timeout if slider is open, and enable a quick toggle switch to "keep screen always on" in the utilities widget and as a standalone 1x1 widget.

= Can you program customization for different buttons or touching the screen or touch buttons to wake it or unlock it? =
No. The android operating system gives us two choices only. Either stick to power button, slide open, any key on slideout (the rules set by the existing lockscreen) or else allow all keys to wake it unconditionally. We can't discriminate once in the all key mode. Keyguard disabler and screenmodewidget are examples of that mode, very simple, a bit obtuse since camera and volume keys are easy to accidental press in the pocket.

= But can you program shake unlocking? =
Yep. A big win since the shake is detected in a sensor which we can definitely control from myLock. Plans are to allow you to choose if you want shake enabled and if so specify whether you want it to unlock to last activity or to the Wakeup homescreen.

= Can you give preferences to answer incoming call without using the touchscreen too? =
Not sure yet. This is a really good idea, as the "call lockscreen" does stand in your way just like the regular one at time.

= Sometimes I see the  lockscreen flash for an instant after the phone wakes up... WTF? =
This happens in alpha 2b and beyond, because we have to tell the main android system that the lockscreen has been dismissed. That fails unless the screen has been awakened and a temporary lockscreen bypass has been initiated. Then we have to create a short delay that the OS expects because the scenario they designed lockscreen bypassing for is where your app ends up getting input from the user that needs to launch something else, at which point it goes back and checks if a password lock was set. For whatever reason, when it does that the flash occurs when secure mode isn't on. When secure mode is on, the password unlock is what would come up and wait for a successful entry. So as we mentioned right now the app won't do you any good when secure mode is on. It's possible that we'll be able to get the wakeup homescreen to work in spite of secure mode (proof of concept is that an alarm clock alarm can go off despite the password mode) and then integrate a widget on your full homescreen to possible quick-disable password mode.

= Why do the volume or camera buttons wake it back up sometimes? =
This is one of the rules of the lockscreen. When a timeout sleep occurs you have a short grace period in which the lockscreen isn't yet engaged, thus allowing any action at all to awaken it again quickly. That means any button, as well as even sliding the slider closed which normally doesn't trigger a wakeup.

= What's the welcome-screen/wakeup homescreen? =
Tentatively titled WakeHome, we are designing a very simple emulation of the stock homescreen with just a single screen, capable of displaying any widget of your choice in addition to any shortcut or app launch icon. Simply a port of the those features from the stock Launcher app. Essentially this is the alternative to quick unlock function (which exists simply to bypass the lockscreen slider and take you to what you were last doing). This mode is inspired by the silencer slider/clock display on the default lockscreen. Why not just make it an extra homescreen and let the user decide what to put there?

= What's notification preview? =
This is a plan for the full final version of the app, way down the road. We think it would be excellent to have a timeline of missed events displayed on the wakeup screen, customized by user to what types of events have the priority of being shown there. A place all in one to view any IMs, twitter, sms, email, missed call, voicemail, etc. 

= It causes me a problem with <insert app name>... WTF? =
it is hard to make the app play nice with other home or screenwake mods because they all rely on workarounds in android to work cleanly. when all these workarounds go in and try to execute in near-tandem, unexpected results will happen. I am aware it doesn't work with screebl and a few others.

= I can't find you on the market? =
That's because myLock isn't on the market yet. I would really like to be, but I'm going to need some donations, as it costs a $25 fee for devs to join the market. I am choosing to create this app as a free & open source project to benefit android lovers, so I imagine once I place it in the app store I will have a donation version also allowing people to buy it for 2 dollars alongside the free download. myLock will never contain ads.

= How do I send you my idea/feedback/bug complaint? =
Email the project mylockandroid at gmail. You can also follow us on twitter and tweet at us if your comment is short. Can't guarantee I'll notice your comments elsewhere like blog, wiki, or will be aware of posts on forums.
